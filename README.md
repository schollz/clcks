a tempo-locked repeat.

![image or video]()

this is a tempo-locked repeater or "stutter" effect, inspired by the op-1's "break" and "chop" [tape tricks](https://teenage.engineering/guides/op-1/tape-mode). the "chop" on the op-1 does not in time with the audio, so i aim to do that here. using softcut, this repeat effect can also be pitched up/down and leveled up/down in realtime, meaning you can also get the "break" effect by setting the final level&pitch down.
