a tempo-locked repeat.

![image or video]()

this is a tempo-locked repeater or "stutter" effect. this effect is inspired by the op-1's "break" and "chop" [tape tricks](https://teenage.engineering/guides/op-1/tape-mode). i like "chop" but the op-1 stops the playing loop when this effect is activated. for *xxx* i wanted a similar effect without stopping the playing loop.

i also used softcut to improve the "chop" effect, by allowing it to be pitched up/down and leveled up/down in realtime. this gives all sorts of new effects, including getting the "break" (tape stop) effect by setting the final level&pitch down.


### Requirements

- audio input
- norns

### Documentation


- press K2 or K3 to activate
- press K2 or K3 to deactivate
- (K2 keeps monitoring audio)
- E1 changes repeat number
- E2&E2 change final level&rate
- hold K1 to shift
- shift+E2 changes tempo
- shift+E3 changes beat subdivision
- shift+K2 resets parameters
- shift+K3 randomizes

other notes:

- repeats >9 means infinite repeating, so you have to toggle off with K2 or K3

## my other patches

- [barcode](https://github.com/schollz/barcode): replays a buffer six times, at different levels & pans & rates & positions, modulated by lfos on every parameter.
- [blndr](https://github.com/schollz/blndr): a quantized delay with time morphing
